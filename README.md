# The Big Brother Modâ„¢Â©Â®

The mod you never knew your villagers needed. Now featuring 120% more propaganda and surveillanceâ„¢.

## Stuff I've added so far
- **ðŸ“¢ Propaganda Loudspeakers and Posters:** Increase villager loyalty dramatically. Totally ethical.
- **ðŸŽ¥ Security Cameras:** Keep an eye on villagers 24/7, ensuring optimal mending productivity (and happinessâ„¢).
- **ðŸª– Militia Villagers:** Bribe villagers for just one emerald to become your personal bodyguards.
- **ðŸ«¡ Loyalty System:** Villagers now remember your actions. Reward them with emeralds and propaganda. Or just smack them and regret it later.
- **ðŸ—¿ Player Statues:** Let villagers worship a stone version of your beautiful Minecraft skin. Good for loyalty, even better for your ego.

# Future plans
Planning a few more meme-ish features before calling it V1.0. Probably singleplayer-only for now. Ideas always welcome, ping me on Slack (same pfp).
