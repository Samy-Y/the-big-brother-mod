# The Big Brother Mod™©®

The mod you never knew your villagers needed. Now featuring 120% more propaganda and surveillance™.

## Stuff I've added so far
- **📢 Propaganda Loudspeakers and Posters:** Increase villager loyalty dramatically. Totally ethical.
- **🎥 Security Cameras:** Keep an eye on villagers 24/7, ensuring optimal mending productivity (and happiness™).
- **🪖 Militia Villagers:** Bribe villagers for just one emerald to become your personal bodyguards.
- **🫡 Loyalty System:** Villagers now remember your actions. Reward them with emeralds and propaganda. Or just smack them and regret it later.
- **🗿 Player Statues:** Let villagers worship a stone version of your beautiful Minecraft skin. Good for loyalty, even better for your ego.
- **❌ Fake Villager:** A decoy villager that can render villagers very aggressive.

# Future plans
Planning another entirely fresh mod with AI villagers. Don't expect updates!

# Installation
Download release 1.0 from the releases tab. Do I really have to explain you how to install a Minecraft mod?
